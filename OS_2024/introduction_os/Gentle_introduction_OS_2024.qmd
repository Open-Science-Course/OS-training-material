## Introduction

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
*Open science is just science done the way science should be done....*
:::

*OR*

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
*In the future there will be science and closed science*

(i.e. -\> what we today call open science will in the future just be science....)

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   We arranged a two-day seminar about open science in research and teaching in 2020

-   The summary of the workshop can be found in the link below

## Access to data

## Question

What do you think is the situation for student thesis?

Could this be a concern?
:::
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
-   When we publish scientific papers it is expected that data is shared (archived) publicly (so that other researchers can reuse the data)

-   However, currently we often find that this is not happening

    -   See e.g. @Archmiller2020

## Question

What do you think is the situation for student thesis?

Could this be a concern?
:::
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
-   When we publish scientific papers - we are expected to share (archive) R-code (or other code we are using to produce the reported results).

-   Again - there is room for improvement!
